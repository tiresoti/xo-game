# Tic Tac Toe
This is my first own C++ OpenGL game for Windows. I made it using GLFW, GLM, FreeType, GLAD and STB libraries.
Try to win the smart computer AI in this classical Tic Tac Toe challenge!

My code is based on Joey De Vries [Learn OpenGL tutorial](https://learnopengl.com/) for making a 2D game Breakout. The */XO Game/framework* folder contains barely changed code from that tutorial. [You can find the source for Breakout here.](https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL/tree/master/src/7.in_practice/3.2d_game/0.full_source) Other files in the root folder of the project are either completely mine or drastically differ from the original.
 ### How to play
 1. Download the repository, unzip it
 2. Open the **Build** folder
 3. Run **XO Game.exe** (you need 64-bit Windows)
 4. Enjoy!

If something goes wrong, the game wouldn't run and an *errors.txt* file will be created.
